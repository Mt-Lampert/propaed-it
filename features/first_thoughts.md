# What's next?

The next thing is **RESEARCH**. We need material. We'll get it from the net. 
Even from darker channels if need be.

Before that we have no content.

And then we need queries. We have to ask people about "Things I wished I had
known at the beginning of my studies."

Before that we have no content of value.


# The Idea

The idea behind it all is to to answer all questions and give out the idea
behind any topic that may come up in the classes.

So the basic idea is a living Wiki.

For Instance, you want to be introduced to "Programming". What awaits you in
the system is a basic intro to programming. 

**The Guide** will ask you some questions and then will introduce you
into the most important concepts:

* Programming is the art of talking to the computer in a way it understands.
* Programming is the art of making the computer do exactly what you want it to
  do.
* Programming is the art of being more explicit, more careful and more vigilant
  in your communication than you usually are with humans, because ..
  
  * The computer doesn't know anything about your world
  * It doesn't know anything about "meaning" unless you teach it.
  * It doesn't know anything about "cohesion" unless you teach it.
  * It doesn't know anything about "the right thing to do" unless you teach it.

Then the guide would show you the easiest way to learn, which is learning Python.
