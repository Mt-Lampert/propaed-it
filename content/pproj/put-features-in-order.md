Once we know about our features, it's a good idea to put them in the right
order. Now, what *is* the right order? Answer: The right order is the order
*that makes a good, logical story,* and the story we want to tell is the story
of using our Task Master. Let's have a look at its aspects again:

* "Dashboard"
* "Checklists"
* "Assignments"
* "Messages"
* "Projects"
* "Users"
* "Teams"

And now something hits my eye: My idea of a good story about using our Task
Master does not begin with anything being listed here. My story begins with the
*Landing Page* of the Task Master. It continues with a *Login* procedure so
that the Task Master can display my projects, my assignments and everything
else that belongs to me as a *registered user*. Once I am logged in, the first
thing I see is my *Dashboard* that lists my *Projects*, my *Assignments*, the
*Messages* I have received since last time I logged in. Moreover, I see an
*Urgent* box on the page showing me to meet some deadline or an important
meeting within a few days or even hours.

The last paragraph is just the beginning of our story, and we can already tell
that it's going to be a very very long one, but for the sake of remaining
fast-paced, excited and motivated about our project, **we let this be enough
for now** and implmement as soon as possible what we have found here.

What we have found is new aspects of our Task Master, and we have found new
order for those aspects:

* "Landing Page"
* "Users"
* "Login"
* "Dashboard"
* "Listing Assignments"
* "Listing Projects"
* "Listing Messages"
* "Listing Urgent Stuff"

Are we finished? Not quite. We have a list of aspects and a few feature names.
What we need however, is a well-ordered list of feature names. So, let's
re-write our temporary list.  To list assignments, projects and messages, we
have to create them. To display a landing page, a dashboard and a login, we
have to create them. So after a little rethinking, this is what I came up with
as my final list of features (for now):

* "Displaying Landing Page"
* "Creating a User (Signup)"
* "Displaying the Login"
* "Executing the Login"
* "Displaying the Dashboard"
* "Creating an Assignment"
* "Listing Assignments"
* "Creating a Project"
* "Listing Projects"
* "Creating a Message"
* "Delivering a Message"
* "Listing Messages"
* "Listing Urgent Stuff"

These are 13 features from Landing Page to Dashboard, ordered in the "right"
order. Implementing them should give us work enough for the next few days,
maybe even weeks. Let's move on.
