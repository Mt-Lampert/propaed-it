It is as logical as it is essential to answer the most basic questions **first.** If you don't, you will always lack orientation ("Where are we actually heading?"), and you will always lack motivation ("Why am I doing this actually? And what for?"). Lack of orientation and motivation are the two undertakers for many, many projects that were doomed to die from the very start. 

So do yourself a favor and answer the following questions **first:**

0. *What is this project all about?*
0. *Who owns this project?* That means: Who makes the final decisions about the project?
0. *What audience will this project be made for?* Who are the people who will use what we try to implement?
0. *What is it that makes this project a project of value?* For me and for everybody else?


#### What is this project all about?

That's very simple (but not always easy): Close your eyes and let your mind fly into the future, to the moment when you look at your finished project and say: This is it! We got it! Hallelujah! (or whatever you say in a moment like this). Now: What do you see right now? Describe it! And describe it in the most motivating manner you can! Your finished project must be *worth* a Hallelujah!

And of course, write your description down! <i class="far fa-grin-wink"></i> When times get tough, it may well get you back on track.

Finally, give your project a name after you have described it like this. This name can be whatever you find appropriate for your idea, for whatever reason. It should be a name that encompasses everything you just described.

#### Who owns this project?

Ownership means both power and responsibility. If you are doing your own project, all the responsibility is yours, but so is all freedom. If you build it for a client (or your professor), the freedom is all his or hers, but you have the responsibility to ask for all specifications you need to implement it.

#### What audience?

Is your project targeting a younger or an older audience? A conservative or an easy-going one? A competent or an incompetent one? A rather male or a rather female one? Is it targeting some kind of "established community" with an established lifestyle (like bikers for instance)? 

At some point in the developing process you will have to decide about how the project should be designed. Knowing the values and preferences of the audience you are targeting is then of tremendous help.

#### What is the value?

The value of your project lies in what your users are missing / missing out
without that thing you are building (And you already have a cool name for it,
haven't you? And you know really well what audience you are targeting, don't
you?). Walk a mile in their shoes (inside your head) and find out what they are
really missing without your project. That's the value you can monetize.

## Example

file: idea.md

Project Name: **Task Master**

#### What is the task manager all about?

The Task Master is a nice little Web app to organize Tasks, projects and
appointments. It's supposed to be fun, it's supposed to be colorful and it's
supposed to be well-structured, highly usable and effective. We will be using
labels, symbols, cards and a sophisticated routing system to achieve this
goal. Task Master will follow the
[Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)
paradigm of *David Allen*.

#### Who owns the project?

The Task Master is intellectual, economical and legal property of *Creative
Buddies Inc.* All responsibility follows the business rule of this
organisation.

#### What audience is Task Master targeting?

Task Master is targeting people who haven't spent much time and effort for
self organizing so far, that means an audience of 18 -- 30 years of age.
People who want to achieve something in life and who want to do what they have
to do more efficiently in order to gain more time for the things they want to
do.

#### What is the Value of Task Master?

The value of Task Master lies in gaining instead of losing time,
it helps finding the rightthing to do instead of not knowing what to do next,
it gives the feeling of being professional, productive and profitable
while having significant "toy value" to play around with the card elements,
colors, fonts, backgrounds and gadgets.
