### Pragmatic and Professional

I just said we want to be pragmatic and professional about our projects. What does this mean? Well ...

**Pragmatic** means:

0. *Features Over Tools:* We use smart tools to implement fancy features. 
   We don't add silly features just to play with fancy tools.

0. *Right Things In The Right Order:* We don't want to lose time and energy doing the right things in the wrong order.

0. *Natural Growth:* We let the project grow naturally. First we implement the roots, then the trunk, then the branches, then the leaves, *and then* we take care about beauty.


**Professional** means:

0. We leave nothing to chance.
0. We follow best practices whenever we can.



### The Road Ahead

So what is it we have to do?


0. [Get the idea](../get-the-idea)
0. [Collect the features](../collect-features)
0. [Put the features in order](../put-features-in-order)
0. Describe the features
    1. Collect the scenarios
    0. Put the scenarios in order
    0. Describe the scenarios     
0. Implement the features
    1. Begin with a failing end-to-end test
    0. Describe the entities
    0. Implement the entities in a test-driven manner
    0. Make the end-to-end test work
    0. Redo!
0. Run all tests
0. Deploy!
