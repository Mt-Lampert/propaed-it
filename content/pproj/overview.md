### Pragmatic and Professional

I just said we want to be pragmatic and professional about our projects. What does this mean? Well ...

**Pragmatic** means:

0. *Features Over Tools:* We use smart tools to implement fancy features. 
   We don't add silly features just to play with fancy tools.

0. *Right Things In The Right Order:* We don't want to lose time and energy doing the right things in the wrong order.

0. *Natural Growth:* We let the project grow naturally. First we implement the roots, then the trunk, then the branches, then the leaves, *and then* we take care about beauty.


**Professional** means:

0. We leave nothing to chance.
0. We follow best practices whenever we can.



### The Road Ahead
