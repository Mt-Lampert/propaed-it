#  About Propaed-IT

This Website is designed for IT rookies who don't know where to begin and what
to do next. My situation some decades ago.

It is and will always be a work in progress. So it can and will never be perfect.

When I launched this project, I was mentoring somebody who didn't know about
IT, didn't know about business and didn't know about projects in the real
world. She went to university to learn it, working desperately more than 50
hours every week, but her teachers failed on her. So she asked me. I saw how
eager she was about it and how often her teachers were teaching details without
showing the big picture or dropping any word about good practice. That became
my job, and looking at her development, I can say I did quite well.

The notes I took, the papers I wrote, the slides I made and our chat messages over time,
they all will contribute to this site. 

It is for you if you want to save time, energy and even money as far as possible
by learning from the lessons I learned from my mistakes. That may save you 
from a lot of pain -- unless of course you want to learn from my mistakes by
making them yourself.

Enjoy, have fun and steal as much as you can.
